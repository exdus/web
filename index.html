        <h2>Perspective</h2>
        <h2>Where Are They?</h2>
        <section class="secTwo">
          <p>Going back to a church and a community where you once pastored or fellowshipped is always an emotional experience.</p>
          <p>It’s encouraging to see the stalwarts who labored with you in the various community and evangelistic events that were run, still faithfully serving God to the best of their ability.</p>
          <p>There’s the joy of seeing former Adventists you had visited, who never showed an inkling of returning to church, but who are now fully committed disciples of Jesus. It’s satisfying to see people you baptized and left as babes in the faith now
            on the church board and leading Sabbath School ministry to children.</p>
          <p>There’s the complete wonder of seeing those you ministered to in Bible studies and seminars, who never made a decision at the time, now rejoicing in the truth of Jesus and involved in helping others find new life through faith in Jesus. I would
            like to stop writing right now, thank God, and just dwell on the above stories, but that’s not the complete picture.</p>
          <p>There are those you remember fondly who are not there anymore.</p>
          <p>After inquiring, you discover a few have passed away and await their joy in Jesus. Others have transferred to new churches. But other stories just bring heartache.</p>
          <p>There’s the Sabbath School teacher who was excellent at building a group and engaging people in the Scriptures, who no longer chooses to fellowship at the church because of hurtful untruths spread around.</p>
          <p>There’s the woman who led in an exercise class that had many community people participating, who no longer attends because the church board did all they could to block and stop her ministry because of the clothes people chose to wear while exercising.</p>
          <p>There are the kids I grew up with in Pathfinders and Sabbath School, now successful lawyers, architects, and businesspeople, who are just not there. Nobody seems to know why.</p>

          <p>Local churches are very fluid. The power of the Word of God and the Spirit change lives that are challenged with relational breakdowns, financial debt, lack of meaningful work, abuse from a partner, jealous retribution from a friend. But some-
            times these human frailties impact others and give people a reason to leave the church.</p>
          <p>There is much latent pain within many churches as those who used to be there and are not anymore are our son or daughter, cousin, brother, sister, uncle, father, mother, best friend. Not having them in church hurts. We pray and know that God
            hears and acts, but God never chooses to force the will of these people who are loved more by Him than us. We know this, but it still hurts.</p>

          <p>As we pray for others, we need to pray for ourselves so that we can endure to the end (Matt. 24:13). For life in the church can be an emotional roller coaster.</p>
          <p>How else can we deal with such pain? Besides prayer, we can choose to be different. Let’s use the pain of loss to move us to become more real: listening, praying, supporting, and advising each other without any judgment (Matt. 7:1, 2; Rom. 13:8;
            Col. 3:13). That’s what it means to be a disciple of Jesus. That’s the kind of church we are all looking for.</p>

          <p> "How often the disciples' experience is ours! When the tempests of temptation gather, and the fierce lightnings flash, and the waves sweep over us, we battle with the storm alone, forgetting that there is One who can help us. We trust to our
            own strength till our hope is lost, and we are ready to perish. Then we remember Jesus, and if we call upon Him to save us, we shall not cry in vain. Though He sorrowfully reproves our unbelief and self-confidence, He never fails to give us
            the help we need. Whether on the land or on the sea if we have the Saviour in our hearts, there is no need of fear. Living faith in the Redeemer will smooth the sea of life, and will deliver us from danger in the way that He knows to be best".<br/><em>{DA

              <h6>It’s a process.</h6>
              <p>One of the key pointers to a great relationship with God is realizing that sanctification doesn’t happen overnight. I can’t expect a relationship with God to immediately be formed; it takes time. I can't expect to understand everything right
                away. I can’t expect to be perfect tomorrow; it takes time. This has helped me be a lot gentler on myself as I remind myself Jesus will take me further tomorrow. I stop fighting and start resting in Him. As I look back, I see the difference.
                I see how God has been working, and I thank Him. It inspires me to be more fully surrendered tomorrow.</p>

              <h5 class=""><a href="" rel="">Prayers</a></h5>
              <p>No prayer is too little for God. Always take time to talk to Him.</p>
              <p>The most refreshing thing to making a relationship with Jesus a success is simply talking to Him more. And don’t just talk, listen too. Have those hard conversations. Talk to Him like a friend. Include him in your day-to-day routine. Maybe
                He’ll answer through His Word or through a wise counselor. Somehow, you’ll know. But you won’t hear an answer if you don’t keep yourself open to it.</p>

              <h5 class=""><a href="" rel="">Above all: We Hope!</a></h5>
              <p>The concept of hope is closely tied to meaning and faith. Hope reinforces the meaning of life. It inspires and enables us to remain positive and proactive.</p>
              <p>It helps us to keep our eyes fixed on our goals, to find the bouyancy to live with purpose and to seize our full potential.</p>
              <p>Why do you dare to hope? This is how christians will answer that question: Because we believe in God who has designed us and made us, Who wants to communicate with us, and who wants to care for us. They will say, we have hope because there
                is God Who loves us.</p>
              <p>Apostle Paul in the thirteenth chapter of the first letter to the church of corinth, concludes that there are three key concepts in the life of the christian: faith, hope and love. But love is even more important, he says, than faith and
                hope.
